# 🏨 Hotel Management System

The Hotel Management System is a desktop application built using C# (Windows Forms), designed to streamline and simplify hotel operations. It provides an intuitive graphical interface for managing core hotel services such as guest reservations, room assignments, staff records, and booking status.

The application connects to a local SQL Server database (via SQL Server Management Studio) to store and retrieve data efficiently. All operations are handled through a well-structured GUI, offering a responsive and user-friendly experience.
